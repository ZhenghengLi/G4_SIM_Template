# G4_SIM_Template

This project maintains a code template for doing the particle detector simulations based on [Geant4](http://geant4.web.cern.ch/) in the high energy physics field. The code template is derived from the developed simulation software for the [POLAR](http://isdc.unige.ch/polar/) mission where the codes of the detailed detector construction and digitization algorithm of POLAR are all removed. This project contains the code template of both the Geant4 simulation part and the digitization part, which can be used for other space-borne missions.
